Hi there!

I am a data engineer, statistician, landscape ecologist and R nerd. I'm currently navigating the transition from ecology and environmental management to the data engineering landscape. I'm also a mechanical keyboard enthusiast ⌨️ with a coffee dependancy ☕ who plays d&d 🎲 a little too much. Let's see how much of that I can work into data projects.
