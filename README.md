Hi there!

I am a lead data engineer specialising in data architecture, solution design and performant big data pipelines. I started my career as a landscape fire ecologist and statistician. I'm also a mechanical keyboard enthusiast ⌨️ with a coffee dependancy ☕ who plays d&d 🎲 a little too much. Let's see how much of that I can work into data projects.
